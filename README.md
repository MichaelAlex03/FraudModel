# Fraud Model

Our project focuses on developing a robust fraud detection model using machine learning techniques. We started with logistic regression as a baseline and then implemented advanced models like XGBoost and random forest, achieving high accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions. Future improvements will include dimensionality reduction and regularization to enhance performance and prevent overfitting.
